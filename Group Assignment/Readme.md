# CFD-Group 10: Assignment: Solution to a porous fin 
Find the updates and changes in codes here. Stuff to do: \
~1. Explore finite volume method~  \
~2. Derive conditions of stability and explain dependance on grid resolution~ \
~3. Add analytical solution comparison to the code~\
~4. Derive other plot-vars~\
~5. Segment the code into a pre-processor (generates inputs), solver, and post-processor to enable investigations on fin efficiency~ \
~6. Create the final documentation using LaTeX~ \
