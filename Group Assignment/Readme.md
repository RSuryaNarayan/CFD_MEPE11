# CFD-Group 10: Assignment: Solution to a porous fin 
Find the updates and changes in codes here. Stuff to do: \
~1. Explore finite volume method~  \
~2. Derive conditions of stability and explain dependance on grid resolution~ \
3. Add analytical solution comparison to the code\
~4. Derive other plot-vars~\
~5. Segment the code into a pre-processor (generates inputs), solver, and post-processor to enable investigations on fin efficiency~

I finally tested it for many test cases changing the Darcy factor *Da* and parameter *xi*  \
