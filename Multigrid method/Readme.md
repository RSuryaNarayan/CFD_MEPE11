# A naive implementation of the V-cycle multigrid method on a laplacian stencil
The 2-D laplace equation is solved with a Dirchlet BC on all walls (set to 40 in the code). I just do 5 smoothening iterations of gauss-siedel before and after the multigrid algorithm. About 50 iterations at the coarsest (though I feel you can still get leaner with that) for the corrections after injecting the residuals. Interpolation to the finest is done following Strang's algorithm of a horizontal sweep followed by a vertical sweep (find the reference in this directory). The results seem satisfying as the solution almost telescopes into the the actual with a single V-cycle.
