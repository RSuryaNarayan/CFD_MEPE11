This is a collection of all the coding assignments as a part of my CFD course at NIT Trichy.
# Comparison of weighted residual methods
You will get a plot like this if you run the .mlx file in the repo. It basically compares the different approximate solutions obtained from weighted residual methods using an interactive MATLAB live script.\

# Some fun with FDM-the Laplacian Stencil
Using the MATLAB script for the 2-D FDM (Finite Difference Method) discretization of the Laplace equation, tweak the boundary conditions to see what you get each time! Here's a Laplacian bathtub! (a higher Dirchlet BC for the north edge)\

A Laplacian bowl-the same Dirchlet BC for all the edges!\

A Laplacian chair-all different Dirchlet BCs for the 4 edges\
